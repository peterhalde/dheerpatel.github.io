# Control for Robotics: From Optimal Control to Reinforcement Learning

Course project at TUM's Learning Systems and Robotics Lab.

## Project Scope
Implementation of various control algorithms on robotic simulations covering:

- Finite/infinite horizon dynamic programming
- Linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
- Model predictive control (MPC)
- Classical reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes

## Key Implementations
- Iterative linear quadratic control
- Approximate dynamic programming
- Custom RL algorithms for robotics applications

## Results
Successfully demonstrated control algorithm performance across multiple robotic simulation environments.
