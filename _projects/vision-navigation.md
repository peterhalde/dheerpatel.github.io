# Vision-based Navigation

Master Practical Course project at TUM's Computer Vision Group.

## Overview
Implementation of structure from motion (SfM) and real time visual odometry (VO) pipelines with focus on:

- Camera models and calibration
- Feature detectors and descriptors
- Triangulation and Bundle Adjustment
- Real-time performance optimization

## Key Features
- Indirect VO with sparse optical flow
- Alternative to traditional feature mapping
- Real-time performance on standard hardware

## Technologies Used
- Computer Vision algorithms
- C++ for performance-critical components
- OpenCV for image processing
- Custom SLAM implementation
